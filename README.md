The actual robot (named slightly differently) was built and developed for a course assignment.

A video of the flawless victory of the robot can be seen in http://vimeo.com/3105046 .

In order to compile this bot mind, install sdcc and run

	$ make

The Makefile also contains sections for reading from a microcontroller, writing a microcontroller, and erasing a microcontroller using a SMT1 burner or similar.
